LaTeX templates for NASA ROSES summary table of work effort and current and pending support

NASA ROSES submissions often require specific formats for the Summary of Work Effort Table and the Current and Pending Support tables. NASA provides templates for these tables, but only in .pdf, .xlsx, and .doc formats. https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/templates-for-earth-science-division-appendix-a-roses-proposals Here I have created a template in LaTex that mirrors the pdf format of the table.

This LaTeX code is intended to be included in a larger proposal document, but this .tex file includes a document declaration and header so that it compiles to produce the accompanied pdf. The header indicates which packages you will need to include in your main document to process these tables.
